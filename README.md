# OOP_5 Project

## Introduction

This project is part of the coursework for the "C++ Programming" subject, focusing on the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It aims to demonstrate the application of OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in C++.

## Features

- **Class Design**: Implementation of various classes that demonstrate encapsulation and abstraction.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Use of inheritance to extend classes along with examples of polymorphism to enhance functionality and flexibility.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Examples of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation to manage resources efficiently.
- **Exception Handling**: Implementation of try, catch, and throw to handle exceptions, ensuring robust error handling and recovery.
- **File I/O**: Demonstration of reading from and writing to files for data persistence.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
- Make (optional for build automation)
